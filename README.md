Created a SQLite database and a table to store product sales data. 
Inserted sample records for different products with their quantities and prices. 
After that, queried the database to calculate the total quantity sold and total revenue for each product. 
Loaded the results into a Pandas DataFrame, printed the summary, and visualized the revenue by product using a bar chart.
